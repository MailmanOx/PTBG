    <h1>History</h1>
    <p> We started our business in 1972. We had a rough start initially, but we later became a local hit in the Cleveland area. </p>

    <h1> About Patrick Thompson </h1>
    <p> Patrick Thompson was born on April 17th, 1954. He shared an interest in food from a young age. His mother often let him cook for his family. This desire to please others with food helped him become who his is today. </p>

    <h1> History of charity </h1>
    <p> Shortly after the Vietnam war ended in 1975, Patrick developed a "Vets eat free" sale, and this sale holds true today. 35% of proceeds until 1985 were given to military charity organizations. Today, we donate to <a href="https://www.stjude.org/">St. Jude </a> for the most part. </p>
